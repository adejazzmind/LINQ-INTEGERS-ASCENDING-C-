Filtering Even Numbers: The Where clause checks if a number is even using the condition n % 2 == 0.
Sorting: The OrderBy method sorts the filtered numbers in ascending order.
Displaying Results: The sorted even numbers are printed using a foreach loop.
This program efficiently combines filtering and sorting operations using LINQ's method syntax, producing the desired output in a concise and readable manner.
